<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>Thank you for purchasing Knit Hat Designer.  This app was developed by Jessica Hedrick and Dave Steele.  Please write us at <a href="mailto:knitting@jessicahedrick.ca">knitting@jessicahedrick.ca</a>.

<p>Knit Hat Designer was built to help you design and knit your own hat.  Aside from the Home screen, this app has three distinct sections: Projects, Design Hat, and Knit.  Each section allows you to manage different aspects of your project and provides you with a button to move to the next screen.  They are organized so that your interaction with the app takes you from left-to-right through the sections, but you can jump to any section at any time using the tab bar at the bottom.  Here is an overview of each section:

<p><b>Projects</b>

<p>The Projects section is where you can choose which hat project you're going to work on.  If you're anything like us, you're not just knitting one hat at a time – you're probably knitting at least three!  The table in the middle of this screen shows you a list of projects that you have available to work on.  The one with the checkmark is the one that you're working on right now.  To change it, just touch the name of the hat that you'd like to work on.

<p>You can also use this screen to add or delete projects from memory.  To add or create a new hat project, just type the name of the project in the “Create a new hat:” field and press the “Go” button on the pop-up keyboard.  You can delete a hat project by pressing the “Delete a Hat” button and then pressing on the name of the hat  that you'd like to delete.

<p><b>Design Hat</b>

<p>The Design Hat section is the creative centre of this app.  In this section you can enter all of the details that help to define your hat project.  What gauge of yarn will you be using?  What style of ribbing would you like?   Navigation through this area is intuitive and easy.  The important thing to remember is that you won't be able to make any changes if your hat is locked.  We'll tell you a bit more about locked hats further down.

<p><b>Knit</b>

<p>Although the previous sections provide you with most of the creative excitement of this app, the Knit section is probably where you'll probably spend most of your time.  This section is where your finished pattern is displayed.  We've done our best to design the app so that you can knit directly from the device itself.  Don't worry if the thought of it already has you reaching for your reading glasses!  There is a button on the top right corner that will change the font size for you so that it's easier to see.

<p>There's also a pop-down section at the top of the screen where you can add notes about your project as you work.  As you're knitting, you'd probably also like to have a way to keep track of your progress.  You're in luck!  Touching an instruction in this section will put a checkmark next to it so that you can remember which steps you've done.

<p>This should be all the instruction that you need to get started, but if you're a person who's interested in the finer details, keep reading!


<h3>Additional Information</h3>

<p><b>Locked Patterns</b>

<p>The purpose of “locking” a pattern is to help you save yourself from accidentally making changes to a pattern after you've started knitting.  You can unlock a pattern at any time on the Modify Hat screen.  If you unlock a pattern, the app will assume that you're starting over and it will remove any progress checkmarks that you may have left on the Knit screen.  Remember that you can always keep multiple projects on the go using the Switch Hat screen.

<p><b>Gauges and Measurements</b>

<p>We suggest that you knit hats according to your measurements exactly when using a yarn consisting mostly of wool or acrylic.  But if you're using cotton, bamboo, linen or alpaca, you should enter your head circumference half an inch smaller than you measured just to be on the safe side.  It is always recommended that you knit a test swatch prior to entering the gauge width and gauge height on the Design Hat screen.

<p><b>Knitting a Test Swatch</b>

<p>In order to knit a test swatch, first check your yarn label for the gauge recommendation.  Cast on two more than the number of stitches specified on the yarn label on the tension square, then measure how many stitches are in four inches and divide by four.  The resulting number is your gauge width.  For gauge height, measure two inches high and divide by two.  If you need more help understanding test swatches, try a google search on "how to knit a test swatch".

<p><b>That's it!</b>

<p>Thank you again for downloading our app.

<p>Sincerely,

<p>Dave and Jess
